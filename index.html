    <p>Hello! I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.</p>
    <p>I'm a tech enthusiast with a love for the outdoors. Cybersecurity, coding, and biking are three of my favorite ways to combine my analytical skills with my sense of adventure and exploration.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about cybersecurity because I love staying up-to-date with the latest threats and finding ways to protect people and organizations. Every day is an opportunity to learn something new, whether it's discovering a new vulnerability or developing a fresh approach to security. I'm excited to be part of a community that's dedicated to keeping the digital world safe.</p>
    <p>I'm also a coder who loves the details - I believe in paying attention to every little thing, from syntax and semantics to user experience and usability. Whether it's designing a UI that's easy to use or crafting a data structure that's efficient and scalable, I know that every line of code is a reflection of my attention to detail.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding or hacking away at cybersecurity threats, you can find me on my bike, doing stunts and living life to the fullest. Whether I'm practing a complex trick or tackling a high jump, I know that I'm exactly where I'm meant to be - surrounded by nature, adrenaline, and good friends.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding or stunting on my bike, you can usually find me doing one of two things: sleeping or binge-watching YouTube videos. There's something about the comfort of my own bed or the endless entertainment of the internet that just calls to me. Whether I'm catching up on the latest cybersecurity news, watching a tutorial on how to improve my coding skills, or simply getting lost in a rabbit hole of cat,sml,minecraft,meme, or prank videos, YouTube has a way of sucking me in and refusing to let me go. And as for sleep, well - let's just say that when I'm not fueling my brain with caffeine and code, I'm probably recharging my brain for the next challenge</p>
    <p>That's everything about me, you can contact me with the bottom at the top of the screen, I may not respond fast but I will respond.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
